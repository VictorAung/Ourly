# Ourly
A simple timekeeping app to log hours. 
Created for the Northwestern Dance Marathon Tech Challenge -2019.
Made for Android and iOS using React Native.

### Problem Statement
Due to new regulations in the nonprofit industry CIS of Chicagoâ€™s employees must track their hours accurately.

## Solution
Our solution focuses on two key aspects of the problem: tracking hours easily and accurately. Users are able to sign in with their ID and our app will automaticlly track their hours until they sign out, providing precision tracking of their hours. 

### How It Works

The landing screen is simple. The user can input their ID and then press enter to sign in.

<!-- | Account Creation  | Sign In |

### Next Steps
Our next steps include: setting up the back end database instead of storing it locally, having alternative sign in methods (QR codes), and putting our app on the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store.
